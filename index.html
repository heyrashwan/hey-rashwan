								<p>Hi! The name is Amir Rashwan Bin Abu Hassan, I live in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia. I am currently working for Nomu Pay Malaysia or formerly known as Wirecard Payment Solutions Malaysia as an inventory officer.</p>
								<p>This is where i am given responsibilities to manage company stocks and assets as to generate reports and take care of the company assets that are mainly EDC machines or a payment terminals.</p>

								<p>I've always have a thing for computer and mobile gadget, curious about what's going on behind all those software or applications that we used every single day. Years before, I used to work in a computer shop. From troubleshooting PCs and laptops, handling and advicing customer request based on their needs and issue with their computers. I mostly work with hardware and navigating software as a Junior IT Assistant. Formating hard disk/installing Window OS, anti virus.</p> -->
